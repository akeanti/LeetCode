```

To make this work properly:

1. Replace `akeanti` with your actual GitHub username
2. Update the progress numbers in the Progress Visualization section
3. Add actual Mermaid.js graphs in the Mermaid code blocks
4. Create the solution structure as shown in the "How to Use" section
5. Add actual problem solution files with proper paths

You can enhance it further by:
- Adding actual Mermaid.js diagrams for specific problems
- Including SVG badges for different programming languages
- Adding a "Contributions" section with your GitHub stats
- Including a "Ranking" section with your LeetCode ranking
- Adding a "Trending Problems" section with popular problems

Remember to:
- Keep the README updated with your progress
- Use consistent formatting for solution explanations
- Add proper code comments in your solution files
- Include test cases and edge cases in your explanations
